In the notification section of settings, there is a new preference: hide message content.<br/><br/>

When enabled, the content of the new message will not be displayed within the notification - only the conversation title. This preference is for those people that want a bit more privacy out of their notifications!<br/><br/>

To hide the conversation title along with the message content, you can make the conversation private, as has always been available.
